## Features

### Backup Creation

- **Local Backup:** Creates an encrypted backup on local storage.
- **Cloud Backup:** Copies the encrypted backup to cloud storage (supported by `rclone`).

### Data Encryption

- The data to be backed up is encrypted with a password of your choosing to prevent unauthorized access.

### Backup Restoration

- **Local Restoration:** Decrypts and restores data from a local backup.
- **Cloud Restoration:** Decrypts and restores data from a cloud backup.

# Setup

### Clone the repo into your desired folder

```powershell
cd path/to/folder
git clone https://github.com/Ghrf6/M122-Backup.git
```

ðŸ’¡ Only for Windows users

### Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your machine

```powershell
wsl --install
```

When WSL is run for the first time, you will be asked to create a user account for the Linux distribution:

- Enter a username.
- Enter a password and confirm it.

### Open a new WSL command interface by searching for Ubuntu

ðŸ’¡ Only for Windows users end

## Install rclone in the shell

```bash
sudo apt install rclone
```

### Connect your desired cloud provider (in this case, Microsoft OneDrive)

```bash
rclone config
```

### This will be asked, type â€˜nâ€™ and press enter

```bash
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
```

### For the name, type â€˜onedriveâ€™. Be careful, it's case-sensitive.

```bash
name> onedrive
```

### Then it will ask you which type of storage you want to use. Select Microsoft OneDrive by typing the number next to your desired cloud provider.

```bash
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
n  / Microsoft OneDrive
   \ "onedrive"
Storage> n
```

### Leave the next two fields empty by pressing enter

```bash
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_id>
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_secret>
```

### Do not edit the advanced config

```bash
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
```

### Use the auto config

```bash
Use auto config?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
```

### Then your browser should open, and you can sign in to your OneDrive account. After that, choose your OneDrive type. We use OneDrive Personal or Business, so type â€˜1â€™.

```bash
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
 1 / OneDrive Personal or Business
   \ "onedrive"
Your choice> 1
```

### Select your specific drive

```bash
Found 1 drives, please select the one you want to use:
0: OneDrive (business) id=xy
Choose drive to use:> 0
```

### Confirm the next two prompts

```bash
Found drive 'root' of type 'business', URL: https://some/url
Is that okay?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
--------------------
[onedrive]
token = {foo, bar}
drive_id = foo
drive_type = business
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Then you should see your current remotes and the option on what to do next. The setup is now finished, and you can quit by typing â€˜qâ€™.

```bash
Current remotes:
Name                 Type
====                 ====
onedrive             onedrive
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

# Backup

### There are three variables that you can change in the `backup.sh` file

- `default_local_backup_base` â€”> This is the folder path where your local backup is going to be stored.
- `default_cloud_backup_base` â€”> This is the folder path where your cloud backup is going to be stored.
- `root_folder` â€”> This is the root folder, and every subfolder will be backed up if they contain a `backup.txt` file.

### If you want a backup to be created from a folder, add a `backup.txt` file.

### Run the script in the shell. You can also change the path to your backup and leave a descriptive message for the backup.

```bash
./backup.sh [options] [message]
```

Options:

- `-l`: Specify the local backup directory (default: /mnt/c/Backup)
- `-c`: Specify the cloud backup directory (default: onedrive:/Backup)
- `-h, --help`: Show the help message

### You have created a backup of the folder locally and in the cloud. In the `backup.txt` file, there will be the commands on how to properly restore your data.

# Restoring your data

### First you need to change the RCLONE_CONFIG variabel to the correct path you can do that by typing in this command:

```bash
rclone config file
```
### Then change to value of the variabel to the shown path

### If you want to restore the data, go to `backup.txt` in your backup folder. It will be structured something like this:

```
Timestamp, message

To restore local data, run:
	./restore_backup.sh <path to backup> <target_directory> local

To restore data from the cloud, run:
	./restore_backup.sh <path to backup> <target_directory> cloud
```

### You can simply change the `<target_directory>` to an existing local directory where you want your data to be stored and then run the command again:

```bash
./restore_backup.sh <path to backup> <target_directory> local
# or
./restore_backup.sh <path to backup> <target_directory> cloud
```

# Automate the backup

### To automate a task you can use a cron job
### Open up the crontab file with the following command: 

```bash
crontab -e
```
### Then select your prefered file editor and in the file add the following

```bash
30 11 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
30 16 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
```

### This will make it so that everyday at 11:30 AM and 4:30 PM it will execute the script and create a backup

### Save and exit the editor
- For vim, save and exit by typing :wq and pressing Enter.
- For nano, save and exit by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and then Enter.
