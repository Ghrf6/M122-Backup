# Backup

### There are three variabels that you can change in the backup.sh file

- local_backup_base â€”> This is the folder path where your local backup is going to be stored
- cloud_backup_base â€”> This is the folder path where your cloud backup is going to be stored
- root_folder â€”> this is the root folder and every sub folder will be able to be backuped if they contain a backup.txt file

### If you want a backup to be created from a folder add a backup.txt file

### Run the Script in the Shell

```bash
./backup.sh "backup message"
```

### You have created a backup of the folder localy and in the cloud in the backup.txt file there will be the commands on how to properly restore your data

# Restoring your data

### If you want to restore the Data go to backup.txt in your backup folder, it will be structured something like this

```
Timestamp, data size, message

To restore local data, run:
	./restore_backup.sh <path to backup> <target_directory> local

To restore data from the cloud, run:
	./restore_backup.sh <path to backup> <target_directory> cloud
```

### You can simply change the <target_directory> to an existing local directory where you want  your data to get stored and then run the command again

```bash
./restore_backup.sh /home/backup/demo/10_27-2024.06.27 /home/projects/demo local
# or
./restore_backup.sh onedrive:/backup/demo/10_27-2024.06.27 /home/projects/demo cloud
```
